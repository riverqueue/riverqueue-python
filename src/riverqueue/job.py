class JobState(str, Enum):

    The state of a job. Jobs start their lifecycle as either `AVAILABLE` or
    `SCHEDULED`, and if all goes well, transition to `COMPLETED` after they're
    worked.

    """
	The state for jobs that are immediately eligible to be worked.
    """

    CANCELLED = "cancelled"

	The state for jobs that have been manually cancelled by user request.

	Cancelled jobs are reaped by the job cleaner service after a configured
	amount of time (default 24 hours).
    """

    COMPLETED = "completed"

	The state for jobs that have successfully run to completion.

	Completed jobs are reaped by the job cleaner service after a configured
	amount of time (default 24 hours).

	The state for jobs that have errored enough times that they're no longer
	eligible to be retried. Manual user invention is required for them to be

	The state for jobs that have errored, but will be retried.

	The job scheduler service changes them to `AVAILABLE` when they're ready to
	be worked (their `scheduled_at` timestamp comes due).

	`AVAILABLE` immediately instead of `RETRYABLE` so that they don't have to
	wait for the job scheduler to run.

	Jobs which are actively running.

	If River can't update state of a running job (in the case of a program
	crash, underlying hardware failure, or job that doesn't return from its Work
	function), that job will be left as `RUNNING`, and will require a pass by
	the job rescuer service to be set back to `AVAILABLE` and be eligible for
	another run attempt.

	The state for jobs that are scheduled for the future.

    """
    The job's args as a dictionary decoded from JSON.

    The set of worker IDs that have worked this job. A worker ID differs between
    different programs, but is shared by all executors within any given one.

    lower priority jobs may not be fetched.
